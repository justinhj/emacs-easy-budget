#summary Notes on the source code

= date-util.el =

Originally when I wrote this program I also wrote my own date library, which managed adding and subtracting dates, figuring out leap years and so on. Of course, emacs had all that already, so recently I refactored things to use only emacs date system. 

date-util.el contains some useful functions that I couldn't find in the emacs libraries already. I may of course be wrong again, but regardless here they are. 

For example in the budget app we often want to compare and manipulate days rather than exact times, so there are functions:

`time-day-earlier`
`time-day-later-or-equal`
`time-add-days`

As an aid to user input I have this function that turns a list into an emacs time

`time-from-dd-mm-yyyy`
