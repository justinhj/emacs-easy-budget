= Ideas =

  * Let user pass in format function for specifying output format
  * Monthly and bi monthly payments, user should specify the calendar days they fall one
  * Sort transactions by date, currently they're not quite by date, just in weekly chunks
  * Kind of weird how weekly budget stuff is calculated, needs to pro-rate? 
  * Integrate with a budget worksheet
  * Allow user to specify a parser to grab bills from their bank statement
  * Customize variable for output folder
  * Customize variable for month day order on date input
  * Better front end for non-elisp users (eg: emacs diary)
